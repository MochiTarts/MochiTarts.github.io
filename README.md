# My Resume Portfolio Site

This is a website I made using Angular. It features some of my skills, work experiences, projects, and miscellaneous stuff about myself.

## Development server

To view this website locally, run ``` ng serve ``` and then navigate to ``` https://localhost:4200 ```. Any changes made to the source files will cause the app to automatically reload.
