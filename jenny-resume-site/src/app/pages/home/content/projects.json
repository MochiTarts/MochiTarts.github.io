Those are just some of the many features we implemented in this app.\n\nFor this app, I had to learn Android Studio and how to apply the MVC model while making different app components. From retrieving data from the SQLite database, to reading data from the database and displaying it with a beautiful UI. Also at the beginning of the project, my team and I decided to use my prototype solution as the starting point of our app. Since it was the cleanest and most-finished out of all of ours.",

We made this using various APIs for getting the desired movies, gifs, and songs. Javascript and nodejs for backend purposes. Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS for making the frontend. And we built a custom API that allows us to communicate between backend and frontend.\n\nThis was by far, the biggest project I've worked on at a hackathon. It proves to me that with a clear end goal and strong dedication, things can be done in a limited amount of time. I had a lot of fun attending this hackathon and learned a lot of skills that proved to be helpful during my co-op term at UTSC the Bridge.",

In certain areas, there are clues that pertain to the traitor's or the heir's identity and the player can cross-reference those clues to each of the King's children's profiles.
